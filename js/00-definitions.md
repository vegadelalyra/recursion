/************************************
 * OFFICIAL DEFINITION OF RECURSION *
 ************************************/

In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code.


/**************************************
 * UNOFFICIAL DEFINITION OF RECURSION *
 **************************************/

Any situation where you do something, and depending on the results, you might do it again.

******************************************************************
 * IN PROGRAMMING, RECURSION OCCURS WHEN A FUNCTION CALLS ITSELF. *
